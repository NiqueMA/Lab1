        <p>Hi all and thank you for visiting my site. My name is Domonique Adams, and I am currently a student at<br>
            <a href="https://www.tri-c.edu/"><strong>Cuyahoga Community College</strong></a>(Tri-C) majoring in Information Technology.<br>
            I previously obtained a Bachelor of Art from <a href="https://www.csuohio.edu/"><strong>Cleveland State University</strong></a>. I hope to be able<br>
            to go on and obtain a masterâ€™s degree in computer science once I complete my degree from Tri-C.</p><br>
    
            <p>I became interested in computers and programming because I had become bored with my normal 9-5 job<br>
             and wanted to learn something new. As I began my journey to learn programming, I found myself highly<br>
            intrigued by how creative you can get when it comes to programming.</p><br>
    
            <p>By taking this course I hope to obtain a better understanding of HTML. I want to become proficient in creating webpages that are not only<br>
                beautiful but functional as well. I have read that HTML and CSS skills are needed when creating mobile apps<br>
                which I am interested in learning how to create. I have previously<br>
                studied HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Python on my own, but I feel there is still a lot of room for improvement.</p><br>
    
            <p>Two of my big dreams I have is to be able to start my own technology company creating software for small and medium businesses<br>
            and maybe one day for some of the biggest companies in the world. Another one of my big dreams, although not school or<br>
            work related, is to move to Texas. My favorite Wikipedia page is for<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sammie> Sammie </a> because he is my favorite singer. </p>
